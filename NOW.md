# NOW — Docs Cleanup Wave A (Policy Convergence)

## Current focus
- Converge duplicated policy authority across:
  - `CONSTRAINTS.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `DOCS_CONTRACT.md`
  - `SANDBOX_PERMISSIONS.md`
  - `docs/PLATFORM_CONSTRAINTS.md`
- Keep edits docs-only, pointer-first, and aligned to `docs/_core/SOURCES_OF_TRUTH.md`.

## NEXT UP
Docs Cleanup Wave B (canonical boundary tightening for summary vs canon docs).
