# 2026-01-13 — Doc sweep + AFM wiring plan

## Summary
- Updated core docs to reflect current OpenVINO reality (int8 for benny-clean, fp16 still present).
- Documented int4 GPU instability and CPU-only fallback constraints.
- Added AFM (Apple Foundation Models) as a planned LiteLLM backend on the Studio.
- Added AFM placeholder test steps and topology references.

## Open Items
- Confirm AFM base URL, model ID(s), and auth behavior before wiring into LiteLLM.
- Decide whether AFM should be LAN-exposed or restricted behind Tailnet.
- If AFM is enabled on :9999, verify it via `GET /v1/models` and add to LiteLLM router/env.
