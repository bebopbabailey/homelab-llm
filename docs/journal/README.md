# Journal

This folder captures ongoing experiments, benchmarks, and hypotheses.

## Integrity
- Entries are append-only. Do not move or delete files in `docs/journal/`.
- Corrections happen via a new dated entry that references the original.
- Always update `docs/journal/index.md` when adding a new entry.

## Entry format
Each entry should include:
- Date
- Goal / question
- Setup (hardware, software versions, model variants)
- Method (inputs, test harness)
- Results (key numbers + qualitative notes)
- Observations / risks
- Next steps
