# optillm-local (Gateway Placeholder)

Status: placeholder directory. No active service is implemented here.

This repo previously experimented with "optillm-local" style deployments; current
runtime uses:
- LiteLLM on the Mini (`layer-gateway/litellm-orch`)
- OptiLLM proxy on the Studio (`layer-gateway/optillm-proxy`, LiteLLM `boost`)
