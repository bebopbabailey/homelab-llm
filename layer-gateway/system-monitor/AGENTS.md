# AGENTS — system-monitor (placeholder)

## Role & Scope
Maintain the system-monitor service only. Do not modify other services unless
explicitly requested.

## Non‑Negotiables
- Monitoring remains separate from user memory/RAG.
- Use the System Documentation DB as the canonical source.

## Start Here
- `SERVICE_SPEC.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DESIGN_STATUS.md`

## Expected Behavior
- Produce status snapshots and incident summaries.
- Do not alter system configuration without explicit approval.
